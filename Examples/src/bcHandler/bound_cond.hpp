  /*! \file bound_cond.hpp
   *  Boundary condition identifiers are formed by a BCType entry,
   *  which select the type of boundary conditions, and a string,
   *  which gives a name of the BC within that type.  For instance:
   *  BCId may contain Dirichlet and "Wall" which identifies the
   *  boundary condition "Wall" of being of Dirichlet type. We will
   *  not allow two BC with the same name, even if they are of
   *  different type The class is a template to allow different
   *  definitions of BCName. Indeed, in many implementations we
   *  require that BCName be just an int. The important thing is that
   *  a BCName should have an ordering since we may use it later as a
   *  key.

  /*!This is a concrete base class to implement boundary conditions in a
   * finite element code. A boundary condition is identified by a type,
   * which is an enum and gives the code the indication on how the bc is applied,
   * a name, which is a string chosen by the user, for instance "wall".
   * A BCBase is uniquely identified by the type and the name.
   * A BCBase contains a vector of indices to "entities", which are tipically
   * the geometry entities to which the bc applies. For a Neumann and Robin
   * boundary contition it will be a list of faces/edges, for a Dirichlet boundary condition a
   * list of nodes. Since the BCBase will be stored in a set we need to make
   * those entities writable on constant objects! So they are declared mutable.
   *
   * A function is recalled by the apply() method, and it implements
   * the boundary condition the function ha as argument the time and the
   * coordinate of a point.
