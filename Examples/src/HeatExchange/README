Little example of a program that computes the temperature in a bar solving
the 1D heat equation with a Gauss-Siedel  iteration. 

Taken and adapted from "Simulation numerique an C++" of I. Danaila, F. Hecht e
   O. Pironneau, 2005

Calling ./plot.sh  you are able to visualize the results.
Or you can laung gnuplot and then at the gnuplot prompt type

gnuplot> plot "result.dat" u 1:2 w lp lw 2 title "uh", "result.dat" u 1:3 w l lw 2title "uex"


make heat_exchange.pdf produce a file with the description of the example.
