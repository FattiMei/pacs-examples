#Utilities for Block preconditioning of saddle point matrices#

This directory contains a few classes for block preconditioners for SaddlePoint matricies arising from the discretization of the Darcy problem

`SaddlePointMat` contains the class for saddle point matrices of the form explained in the paper

 `preconditioner` the block preconditioners used in the cited paper.
 
 There are also various utilities for handling the block matrix.
