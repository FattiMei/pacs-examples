To run this tests you have first to ensure that the local Makefile.inc
contains the indication of the directory where umfpack.h is contained
and where libumfpack.so or libumfpack.a is contained.

To have reasonable results about timings you should compile WIT NO
DEBUGGING ACTIVATED, by typing

make DEBUG=no

Of course take out DEBUG=no if you want debugging

Then you can edit data.pot (or copy to another file and modify the copy) to select solver parameters and the solver type (direct and iterative)

./test_all <-i datafile> to launch the program if -i datafile is missing data.pot is taken.
