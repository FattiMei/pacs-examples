A simple class for full matrices. An example on how to swotch from row major to column major ordering. 

Some utilities are introduced to implement matrix matrix multiplication, in the standard or in a more cache friendly way.

The main uses the utility chrono and links to libpacs in ../../lib. If you use the dynamicl library set

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=:../../lib

To compile the libpacs library you need to go in ../Utilities and run

make DEBUG=no
make install

run_main.sh is a script to run the code (it sets LD_LIRBARY_PATH).

To compile with optimization use

make DEBUG=no
