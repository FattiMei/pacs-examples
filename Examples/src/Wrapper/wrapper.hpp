/*!  This class implements a generic wrapper for the bridge pattern. Its
  role is to ease the memory management of object which are used
  polymorphycally by a class in order to implement a rule.  It is a
  modification of the class presented by Mark Joshi in his book "c++ dsign
  patterns and derivative pricing", Cambridge Press. This version mekes use
  of std::unique_ptr to ease the handling of the pointers.
  
  
  We make an example to illustrate the problem. The general structure
  without the wrapper would be
  
  \verbatim
  
  A hierarchy of classes which implements a certain rule
  
  class B;
  
  class D1: public B ......
  
  A class that uses that rule by containement:
  
  class UseB{
  public:
  UseB(B *, ..); The constructor takes a pointer (or a reference)
  to B
  ....
  methods that use B* polymorphically
  ....
  private:
  B * Impl;  A pointer (or reference) to B
  \endverbatim
  
  The problem here is that the scope of an object of type UseB and that
  of the object of the base class B (or possibly reference) passed to the
    constructor are linked. For instance the statement
    
    \verbatim
    
    B* a = new D1;
    UseB foo(a,...)
    delete a;
    \endverbatim
    
    would be invalid because the copy of a stored in foo is now dangling. A
    similar situation happens with references.
    
    The root of the problem lies in the fact that the responsibility of
    correctly handling the object pointed by a is left to the procedure
    which instantiates UseB, while it should be responsibility of UseB
    itself. This is confusing and prone to error.
    
    The use of the bridge pattern through a wrapper overcomes the
    problem. A wrapper contained in UseB takes care of memory management and
    implementing polymorphism by dereferencing a pointer to the base class.

    Here a generic wrapper is implemented as a template class. The templete
    parameter T should be set to the BASE class of the hierarchy. In the
    previous example the situation would change in
    
    \verbatim
  class UseB{
  public:
  UseB(const B &, ...); The constructor takes a reference to B
  ....
  methods that use B* polymorphically
  ....
  private:
  Wrapper<B> Impl;  A wrapper which handles the management of A COPY
  of the object passed by the constructor, thanks to the method
     clone().
     \endverbatim

     \pre The parameter class T must have a virtual method with the
     signature T * clone() const. Beware that T must be the base class and
     that the method clone () must be const.
     

     The interesting bit is that by use of implicit conversion and
     overloading of the dereferencing operators * and -> makes the use of
     the wrapper transparent!. The routine that instantiate useB require
     little if no change at all.
