Since C++11 we can initialize vectors, arrays but also user defined
aggregates, but also classes, using the {} syntax. Here a few examples.

The compiler gives some warnings about unused variables, ignore it,
this is just an example with no practical use.

NOTE: to avoid warnings I have used a compiler pragma, so this is also
an example of use of pragmas

Note also that arrays of aggregates need an extra bracket. Maybe it
will be changed in the next standard to make the code simpler.
