QuadratureRuleQuadratureRule#A few examples on floating points#

- `FPComparison` Comparing two floating points for equality may fail becouse of roundoff;
- `FPException` An utility to help handling floating point exceptions;
- `FPfailure` An example that show a degenerate situation where becouse of floating point roundoff error you do not get what you should get;
- `FinDiff` An example which shouws how cancelation errors may ruin the theoretical convergence of finite difference approximation of derivatives if you take a step too small;
- `Quadratic root` How to compute the root of a quadratic reducing roundoff errors.
