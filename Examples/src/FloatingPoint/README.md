#A few examples on floating points#

- `FPComparison` Comparing two floating points for equality may fail becouse of roundoff
- `FPException` An utility to help handling floating point exceptions
- `FPfailure` An example that show a degenerate situation where becouse of floating point roundoff error you do not get what you should get
- `FinDiff` An example which shouws how cancelation errors may ruin the theoretical convergence of finite difference approximation of derivatives if yo take a step too small
