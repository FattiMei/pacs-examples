This examples show how metaprogramming can improve the efficiency of
your code.  You need first to compile and install the Utilities (in
the named directory), since we use the Chrono utility to compute
elapsed time.

To have the real full performance you need to compile with optimization on

make DEBUG=on

Remember that in this case the Examples/lib directory is not indicated
to the loader, so, if you use the shared version of libpacs you need
also to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly.

See the file run.sh.
