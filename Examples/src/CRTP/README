A simple example of the Curiously Recursive Template Pattern (CRTP).

class Derived1: public Base<Derived1>

The derived class is the template argument of the base class.

This allows to implement what is often calls "static polymorphism". A
form of polymorphism much less flexible than the standard one
(everything must be resolved at compile time), but particularly
efficient if methods of the class are used many times in the program.
It is used extensively by the EIGEN library.
