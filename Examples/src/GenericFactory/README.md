# A generic object factory #

Based on a simplified version of that of the book
of Alexandrescu.

We also give an example of a  generic proxy class that may be used to
register objects in the Factory

Do ``make exec`` to produce the executable that tests the Factory and make
install to install it in the proper directory so that other Examples
may include it.
