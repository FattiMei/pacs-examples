\section*{Esercizio 1}

Starting from the example \texttt{QuadratureRule/baseVersion}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item extend the use of GetPot in order to pass the integrand function
  directly from the data file

  \item add a Gaussian quadrature rule, templatized on the number of quadrature
  points. The Gaussian rule should derive from the common base class
  \cpp{StandardQuadratureRule}. The points and weights can be computed using the
  \texttt{legendre\_rule} library

  \item compute the integral of the function
    \begin{align*}
    f(x) = e^x x
    \end{align*}
  in $[0,1]$ using all the available quadrature rules.

  \item implement a MonteCarlo quadrature rule, that also derives from
  \cpp{QuadratureRule}.
\end{enumerate}
