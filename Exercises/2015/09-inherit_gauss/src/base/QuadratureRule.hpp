  /*! \brief  A base class for standard quadrature rules.
    
    This class provides the common interface to  a quadrature rule in
    the interval \f$[-1,1]\f$ computed by the formula

    \f$ \int_{-1}^{1} f(y) dy \simeq  \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}w_i f(y_i)\f$

    It also provides the containers for nodes \f$y_i\in[-1,1]\f$ and
    corresponding weights \f$w_i\f$.  This is the base class, the
    derived class constructs the appropriate points and weights. No
    method is overritten in the derived class (a part the destructor
    and the clone method).

    Constructors and assignement operators
    are not defined since the synthetic ones are sufficient.

    This version implements the virtual constuctor paradigm through the
    method clone();
