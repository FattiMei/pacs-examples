Dynamic loading of numerical rules and integrands:
go in ../base version and do

make dynamic
make install

go in ../generic_factory
and do

make install

Data read from quadratura.getpot (a getpot file)

To compile the libraries
make dynamic

to compile the executable

make exacutable

library binding is local unless DEBUG=no is indicated

if you use the macro DEBUG=no (es: make exec DEBUG=no)
you compile with -O3 


The linking is alwais made against libraries in Examples/lib a part
for the local directories containing the proxy to the rules (used to
register rules in the factory) and the library with the integrands.
