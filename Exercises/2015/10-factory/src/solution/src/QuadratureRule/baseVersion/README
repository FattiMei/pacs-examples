Basic classes and function for numerical integration

To compile with dynamic libaries 
make dynamic

to compile with static libraries

make static

library binding is local unless DEBUG=no is indicated

to install libraries and headers in the directories lib eand include
under the Example directory (where we put headers and libraries of the
course) do

make dynamic DEBUG=no
make static DEBUG=no
make install

===

make exec DEBUG=no LIBTYPE=STATIC/DYNAMIC

compiles the exec without recompiling the libraries and do not use
local (i.e.  current directory) linking but used the directories in
Examples/lib. use static/dynamic if you want static or dynamic linking.
